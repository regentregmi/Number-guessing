# Number-guessing

The Number Guessing Game is a classic beginner-friendly Python project. In this game, the computer randomly selects a number within a given range (for example, 1 to 100), and the player tries to guess what the number is. The computer gives hints after each guess, telling the player whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
